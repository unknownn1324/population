# Population
This repository contains a dataset and Python script for analyzing the population of various US states. 
The dataset includes the estimated population numbers for a sample of 10 states, and the Python script provides basic statistical analysis of the population data.

## Dataset

The dataset includes the following columns
- *State*: Name of the US state
- *Population*: Estimated population of the state

The data in this example includes 10 states: California, Texas, Florida, New York, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Ohio, Georgia, North Carolina, and Michigan.

## Python Script

The Python script `population_data.py` performs the following tasks:
------

- Creates a DataFrame with population data for US states.
- Provides basic statistics about the population data, such as:
  - The total number of states.
  - The state with the highest population.
  - The state with the lowest population.
  - The average population of all states in the dataset.
- Saves the population data to a CSV file (`us_population_data.csv`).
